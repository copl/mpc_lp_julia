/homogeneous_algorithm/    The interior point algorithm for solving non-linear programs.

/modeling_tools/           Allows the user to build non-linear programs before giving it to the solver.

/presolve/        Reduces the size of optimization problem to improve solver efficiency.

/warm_starting/   Picks a good intial point given a previous optimal point.
