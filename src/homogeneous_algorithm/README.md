Solver (ip_algorithm.jl) is based on "A Computational Study of the Homogeneous Algorithm for Large-scale Convex Optimization" by Erling D. Andersen and Yinyu Ye (homogenous_algorithm.pdf, pg 251 to 257)

There is also more recent work by Huang and Mehrotra (homogenous_potential_function.pdf) that use a potential function to improve the runtime. The paper also corrects multiple typing errors from Andersen and Ye. 

To decide if the problem is primal or dual infeasible see homogeneous_infeas_cert.pdf
